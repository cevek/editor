00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,170
<i>What are you doing, John?</i>

2
00:00:02,252 --> 00:00:03,962
<i>Looking at you.</i>

3
00:00:05,005 --> 00:00:07,005
<i>Come here.</i>

4
00:00:12,763 --> 00:00:14,763
<i>Are you still filming?</i>

5
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:22,430
<i>Just an anniversary.</i>

6
00:03:22,534 --> 00:03:24,074
It's been a while.

7
00:03:25,453 --> 00:03:27,033
My condolences.

8
00:03:28,790 --> 00:03:30,250
How are you holding up?

9
00:03:31,042 --> 00:03:34,132
I keep asking, "Why her?"

10
00:03:34,212 --> 00:03:37,512
There's no rhyme or reason to this life.

11
00:03:37,591 --> 00:03:40,971
It's days like today
scattered among the rest.

12
00:03:41,845 --> 00:03:43,465
Are you sure?

13
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:45,675
Don't blame yourself.

14
00:03:48,852 --> 00:03:51,652
What are you really doing here, Marcus?

15
00:03:54,190 --> 00:03:56,860
Just checkin' up on an old friend.

16
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,370
Good-bye, John.

17
00:04:38,067 --> 00:04:40,397
- John Wick?
- Yes.

18
00:04:40,486 --> 00:04:42,066
Sign here, please.

19
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:51,034
And the pen.

20
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:53,170
Sorry.

21
00:04:53,249 --> 00:04:55,499
- Here you go. Good night.
- Thanks.

22
00:05:25,906 --> 00:05:29,366
<i>"John, I'm sorry I can't be there for you.</i>

23
00:05:29,451 --> 00:05:32,871
<i>But you still need something,
someone to love.</i>

24
00:05:32,955 --> 00:05:35,455
<i>So start with this.</i>

25
00:05:35,541 --> 00:05:38,551
<i>Because the car doesn't count.</i>

26
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:40,457
<i>I love you, John.</i>

27
00:05:40,546 --> 00:05:42,796
<i>This illness has loomed over us
for a long time...</i>

28
00:05:42,881 --> 00:05:44,801
<i>and now that I have
found my peace, find yours.</i>

29

found my peace, find yours.</i>

30
00:05:44,883 --> 00:05:46,723
<i>and now that I have
found my peace, find yours.</i>

31
00:05:46,747 --> 00:05:50,917
<i>Until that day, your best friend, Helen."</i>

32
00:06:27,217 --> 00:06:28,797
Hey.

33
00:06:32,180 --> 00:06:33,680
Hey.

34

Daisy.

35
00:06:41,481 --> 00:06:43,031
Of course.

36
00:06:47,779 --> 00:06:48,859
Hey.

37
00:06:54,536 --> 00:06:56,036
Come on.

38
00:07:20,811 --> 00:07:22,651
I'm up. I'm up.

39
00:07:22,730 --> 00:07:26,070
I'm u... I'm up.

40
00:07:44,251 --> 00:07:45,751
Hey.

41
00:07:47,463 --> 00:07:49,913
Oh. Right.

42
00:08:03,270 --> 00:08:04,610
What?

43
00:08:14,365 --> 00:08:16,945
We'll grab you some kibble later.

Nice ride.

51
00:09:50,335 --> 00:09:52,875
Mustang. Boss 429.

52
00:09:53,838 --> 00:09:55,718

00:09:57,258 --> 00:09:58,798
Huh.

55
00:09:58,885 --> 00:10:01,385
- Beautiful car.
- Thanks.

56
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:06,728
- How much?
- Excuse me?

57
00:10:07,476 --> 00:10:09,056
How much for the car?

58
00:10:10,062 --> 00:10:11,902
She's not for sale.

59
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:16,780
Oh, I love dogs.

60
00:10:28,580 --> 00:10:31,040
You have good day, sir.

61
00:12:01,173 --> 00:12:03,293
All right. Come on, then.

62
00:12:07,095 --> 00:12:08,675
How you doin'?

63
00:12:20,525 --> 00:12:22,065
You need to go?

64
00:13:10,825 --> 00:13:12,195

Huh? I want a new VIN number
and some clean papers.

69
00:15:16,616 --> 00:15:18,236
Where'd you get that car?

70
00:16:11,254 --> 00:16:12,704
Is it here?

71
00:16:22,723 --> 00:16:24,053
It was.

72
00:16:26,436 --> 00:16:29,896
- I asked you where the hell did you get it?
- Who gives a shit?

73
00:16:29,981 --> 00:16:32,941

Viggo's son.

75
00:16:36,946 --> 00:16:38,276
Yeah.

76
00:16:40,950 --> 00:16:43,580
Get out of my shop. Get out right now.

77
00:16:43,661 --> 00:16:47,001
Did you just lose your shit, Aurelio?
Because we own you.

78
00:16:52,545 --> 00:16:55,165
What did you say?
What did you say to me?

79
00:16:55,256 --> 00:16:56,756
We own you.

80
00:16:57,967 --> 00:16:59,717
You don't own me, punk.

81
00:16:59,802 --> 00:17:01,932
I work with your father. All right?

82
00:17:03,389 --> 00:17:05,979
The owner of that car,
did you kill him or what?

83
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,388
No.

84
00:17:07,477 --> 00:17:10,107
We sure as hell fucked up his dog.

85
00:17:10,188 --> 00:17:12,648
You fucked up his dog?
That's what you did?

86
00:17:12,732 --> 00:17:14,362
Yeah.

87
00:17:14,442 --> 00:17:16,112
That's crazy shit, man.

88
00:17:20,573 --> 00:17:23,283
Oh, look at you. That's great.

89
00:17:23,367 --> 00:17:25,657
You're gonna come into my shop
and pull a gun on me.

90
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,245
That's great, man. Come on.

91
00:17:28,331 --> 00:17:29,961
Now, you kill me right now...

92
00:17:30,041 --> 00:17:33,341
or you get the fuck out of my shop.

93
00:17:35,755 --> 00:17:38,675
Viggo is not gonna like this.

94
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:41,598
How do you know what Viggo likes
or doesn't like?

95
00:17:41,677 --> 00:17:44,007
I'll tell you somethin'
he's gonna understand.

96
00:17:47,350 --> 00:17:50,350
You've got a fuckin' pair on you, old man!

97
00:17:52,563 --> 00:17:55,813
I guess we'll be takin' our business
someplace else.

98
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,861
<i>So what are you gonna do?</i>

99
00:18:12,750 --> 00:18:14,710
I need a ride.

100
00:18:29,141 --> 00:18:30,731
Aurelio speaking.

101
00:18:33,396 --> 00:18:35,396
I heard you struck my son.

102
00:18:36,732 --> 00:18:39,402
<i>- Yes, sir, I did.</i>
- And may I ask why?

103
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:43,025
Yeah, well, because he stole
John Wick's car, sir...

104
00:18:43,114 --> 00:18:46,534
and, uh, killed his dog.

105
00:18:51,581 --> 00:18:53,081
Oh.

106
00:19:22,111 --> 00:19:23,781
Viggo.

107
00:19:23,863 --> 00:19:25,363
Yeah?

108
00:19:25,448 --> 00:19:28,288
They've agreed to your terms.

109
00:19:28,367 --> 00:19:31,867
It's not like you gave them
much of a choice anyway though, right?

110
00:19:33,956 --> 00:19:35,576
Congratulations.

111
00:19:38,961 --> 00:19:40,381
Sir?

112
00:19:42,965 --> 00:19:44,965
Have you seen my son?

113
00:20:02,318 --> 00:20:03,948
How was your trip, kid?

114
00:20:04,028 --> 00:20:06,488
We won't be hearing
from them anytime soon.

115
00:20:06,572 --> 00:20:08,082
Or ever.

116
00:20:32,139 --> 00:20:34,099
That's a nice jacket.

117
00:20:34,183 --> 00:20:35,513
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

118
00:20:38,688 --> 00:20:40,438
Ugh.

119
00:20:46,028 --> 00:20:48,448
Should I go?

120
00:20:48,531 --> 00:20:52,371
<i>Nyet.</i>

121
00:20:52,451 --> 00:20:55,211
- Viggo, English, please. Come on.
- Stay, goddamn it!

122
00:20:55,287 --> 00:20:58,127
What did I do?

123
00:21:00,501 --> 00:21:03,961
We did what you asked. No one saw shit.

124
00:21:08,008 --> 00:21:10,598
I'm not talking about Atlantic City.

125
00:21:11,804 --> 00:21:13,464
What then?

126
00:21:13,556 --> 00:21:16,726
You mean Aurelio's?
So I stole a fucking car!

127
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:18,149
Aw, fuck, Viggo!

128
00:21:18,227 --> 00:21:20,017
- Christ, Viggo.
- You stay!

129
00:21:40,249 --> 00:21:44,209
It's not what you did, son,
that angers me so.

130
00:21:44,295 --> 00:21:46,205
It's who you did it to.

131
00:21:46,297 --> 00:21:48,927
Who? That fucking nobody?

132
00:21:50,593 --> 00:21:52,753
That "fuckin' nobody"...

133
00:21:54,889 --> 00:21:56,269
is John Wick.

134
00:22:11,489 --> 00:22:14,199
<i>He once was an associate of ours.</i>

135
00:22:16,118 --> 00:22:18,368
They call him <i>Baba Yaga.</i>

136
00:22:21,373 --> 00:22:22,703
The boogeyman?

137
00:22:22,792 --> 00:22:24,922
Well, John wasn't exactly the boogeyman.

138
00:22:29,340 --> 00:22:32,970
He was the one you sent to kill
the fucking boogeyman.

139
00:22:37,264 --> 00:22:38,554
Oh.

140
00:22:38,641 --> 00:22:41,311
John is a man of focus...

141
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:43,650
commitment...

142
00:22:44,313 --> 00:22:45,763
sheer will.

143
00:22:47,024 --> 00:22:49,984
Something you know very little about.

144
00:22:51,570 --> 00:22:54,990
I once saw him kill three men in a bar...

145
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:56,484
with a pencil.

146
00:22:58,077 --> 00:22:59,287
With a fuckin'...

147
00:23:02,540 --> 00:23:04,130
pencil.

148
00:23:11,549 --> 00:23:15,179
Then suddenly one day he asked to leave.

149
00:23:16,595 --> 00:23:18,675
It's over a woman, of course.

150
00:23:24,353 --> 00:23:26,473
<i>So I made a deal with him.</i>

151
00:23:27,773 --> 00:23:31,643
I gave him an impossible task.

152
00:23:32,695 --> 00:23:35,985
A job no one could have pulled off.

153
00:23:42,329 --> 00:23:45,169
The bodies he buried that day...

154
00:23:46,375 --> 00:23:49,455
laid the foundation of what we are now.

155
00:23:53,966 --> 00:23:55,506
And then, my son...

156
00:23:56,552 --> 00:23:59,182
a few days after his wife died...

157
00:24:00,389 --> 00:24:01,729
you steal his car...

158
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:05,690
and kill his fuckin' dog.

159
00:24:05,769 --> 00:24:08,729
Father, I can make this right.

160
00:24:08,814 --> 00:24:11,604
Oh. How do you plan that?

161
00:24:11,692 --> 00:24:13,612
By finishing what I started.

162
00:24:13,694 --> 00:24:15,814
Did he hear a fucking word I said?

163
00:24:18,324 --> 00:24:20,864
Iosef, Iosef, listen.

164
00:24:24,079 --> 00:24:26,079
John will come for you.

165
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,507
<i>And you will do nothing...</i>

166
00:24:33,589 --> 00:24:35,589
because you can do nothing.

167
00:24:35,674 --> 00:24:38,344
So get the fuck out of my sight.

168
00:25:07,498 --> 00:25:09,038
<i>Hello, John.</i>

169
00:25:12,127 --> 00:25:14,377
I heard about your wife, and I'm sorry.

170
00:25:14,463 --> 00:25:15,963
My condolences.

171
00:25:18,467 --> 00:25:22,557
<i>It seems to be fate, or happenstance...</i>

172
00:25:22,638 --> 00:25:26,728
<i>or just bad fuckin' luck
caused our paths to cross once again.</i>

173
00:25:31,355 --> 00:25:32,975
John?

174
00:25:36,819 --> 00:25:40,239
Let us not resort to our baser instincts...

175
00:25:40,322 --> 00:25:42,912
<i>and handle this like civilized men...</i>

176
00:25:42,992 --> 00:25:44,742
<i>to move on...</i>

177
00:25:55,504 --> 00:25:57,084
What'd he say?

178
00:25:59,174 --> 00:26:00,464
Enough.

179
00:26:00,551 --> 00:26:02,761
Oh, God.

180
00:26:05,973 --> 00:26:07,513
Task a crew.

181
00:26:08,934 --> 00:26:10,264
H-How many?

182
00:26:10,352 --> 00:26:12,862
How many do you have?

183
00:27:36,021 --> 00:27:38,021
<i>Baba Yaga.</i>

184
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:24,018
Evenin', John.

185
00:30:24,106 --> 00:30:26,186
Evenin', Jimmy.

186
00:30:26,275 --> 00:30:27,895
Noise complaint?

187
00:30:29,069 --> 00:30:30,989
Noise complaint.

188
00:30:41,790 --> 00:30:43,210
You, uh, workin' again?

189
00:30:43,292 --> 00:30:45,712
No, just sortin' some stuff out.

190
00:30:46,712 --> 00:30:48,672
Ah, well...

191
00:30:51,383 --> 00:30:53,753
I'll leave you be then.

192
00:30:53,844 --> 00:30:56,344
- Good night, John.
- Good night, Jimmy.

193
00:31:12,029 --> 00:31:14,489
This is Wick.

194
00:31:14,573 --> 00:31:16,733
Yes, John Wick. That's right.

195
00:31:16,825 --> 00:31:19,995
I'd like to make
a dinner reservation for 12.

196
00:31:38,847 --> 00:31:40,767
Good to see you, John.

197
00:31:40,849 --> 00:31:42,389
Charlie.

198
00:31:54,863 --> 00:31:57,113
You look good.

199
00:31:57,199 --> 00:32:00,239
And here I'd feared
you'd left all this behind.

200
00:32:42,327 --> 00:32:45,327
Will I be hearin' from you anytime soon?

201
00:32:46,581 --> 00:32:48,711
Good-bye, Charlie.

202
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,752
John.

203
00:32:54,881 --> 00:32:56,721
Of course he did.

204
00:32:57,801 --> 00:33:00,511
Put a contract on John Wick.

205
00:33:00,595 --> 00:33:02,215
How much?

206
00:33:02,305 --> 00:33:04,345
Two million.

207
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:13,276
English, Viggo, please.

208
00:33:16,862 --> 00:33:20,992
Put Iosef in the Red Circle and wait.

209
00:33:22,784 --> 00:33:24,074
For what?

210
00:33:24,161 --> 00:33:26,911
For John Wick, of course.

211
00:33:51,813 --> 00:33:53,393
Thank you.

212
00:33:55,442 --> 00:33:57,952
To what do I owe this visit?

213
00:34:01,698 --> 00:34:04,448
I have a job for you.

214
00:34:04,534 --> 00:34:06,114
And I've got a phone.

215
00:34:06,203 --> 00:34:08,363
Hmm.

216
00:34:08,455 --> 00:34:11,075
I want to offer you this face to face...

217
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:15,665
seeing as how you might find it personal.

218
00:34:17,339 --> 00:34:20,009
Would you kill John Wick
for two million dollars?

219
00:34:23,845 --> 00:34:26,345
After all, you were close.

220
00:34:27,849 --> 00:34:31,479
- Is the contract exclusive?
- No, it's open.

221
00:34:31,561 --> 00:34:34,571
It's a timely matter.
It has to be handled quickly.

222
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,150
Consider it done.

223
00:34:38,693 --> 00:34:41,813
Thank you, Marcus.
I know I can trust you.

224
00:34:41,905 --> 00:34:43,525
Thanks for the drink.

Thanks.

248
00:36:53,953 --> 00:36:55,323
Good seeing you again, John.

Perkins.

250
00:37:00,168 --> 00:37:02,418
I have you for two nights.

251
00:37:02,504 --> 00:37:05,294
- Depending on business, it may be more.
- Of course, sir.

252
00:37:06,341 --> 00:37:09,471
So when did the old place get a face lift?

253
00:37:09,552 --> 00:37:11,012
Around four years ago.

254
00:37:11,096 --> 00:37:12,426
But I assure you, sir...

255
00:37:12,514 --> 00:37:14,424
she really hasn't changed much.

256
00:37:14,516 --> 00:37:17,186

- Same owner.

Room 818.

258
00:37:28,321 --> 00:37:29,821
And, as always...

259
00:37:30,657 --> 00:37:32,367
it is a pleasure...

260
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:36,000

Jonathan.

268
00:39:38,660 --> 00:39:40,410
Now, as I recall...

269
00:39:40,495 --> 00:39:44,745
weren't you the one tasked to
dole out the beatings, not receive them?

270
00:39:44,833 --> 00:39:46,413
Rusty, I guess.

271
00:39:47,335 --> 00:39:49,165
To what do we owe the pleasure?

272
00:39:50,839 --> 00:39:52,839
Iosef Tarasov.

273
00:39:53,925 --> 00:39:56,675
- What about him?
- I'd like to talk with him.

274
00:39:57,387 --> 00:40:00,467
A talk, you say.

275
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:05,602
I'm familiar with the parlance, Jonathan.

276
00:40:06,396 --> 00:40:08,936
I want to ask you this.

277
00:40:09,023 --> 00:40:11,023
Have you returned to the fold?

278
00:40:12,151 --> 00:40:14,451
Just visiting.

279
00:40:14,529 --> 00:40:16,569
Have you thought this through?

280
00:40:16,656 --> 00:40:20,536
I mean, chewed down to the bone?

281
00:40:21,661 --> 00:40:24,041
You got out once.

282
00:40:24,122 --> 00:40:26,582
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond...

283
00:40:26,583 --> 00:40:27,123
You dip so much as a pinky
back into this pond...

284
00:40:28,376 --> 00:40:32,086
you may well find something reaches out...

285
00:40:32,171 --> 00:40:34,631
and drags you back into its depths.

286
00:40:34,716 --> 00:40:36,756
Where do I find him?

287
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:42,466
Hey. Wick's at the Continental.

288
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:46,809
Welcome home, John.

289
00:40:46,895 --> 00:40:49,725
We have a contact there
who's willing to take him out for us.

290
00:40:49,814 --> 00:40:51,434
Yeah?

291
00:40:52,692 --> 00:40:54,282
How brazen.

292
00:40:56,738 --> 00:41:00,528
If they're willing to break the rules of
Continental, double the bounty.

293
00:41:00,617 --> 00:41:02,997
You know the rules.

294
00:41:03,077 --> 00:41:05,327
No business can be conducted
on these premises...

295
00:41:05,413 --> 00:41:09,243
lest incurring heavy penalties.

296
00:41:12,378 --> 00:41:13,708
Have a drink...

297
00:41:15,715 --> 00:41:17,425
and relax...

298
00:41:19,802 --> 00:41:21,812
for now.

299
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:26,636
It's personal.

- Hey, Addy.
- My God!

303
00:41:37,487 --> 00:41:40,407
How long has it been? Four years?

304
00:41:40,490 --> 00:41:41,780
Five and change.

305
00:41:41,866 --> 00:41:45,746
So tell me, how was life
on the other side?

306
00:41:45,828 --> 00:41:47,708
It was good, Addy.

307
00:41:47,789 --> 00:41:49,829
Far better than I deserved.

308
00:41:50,875 --> 00:41:52,915
Hey, I'm sorry to hear about your...

309
00:41:53,002 --> 00:41:54,592

310

311
00:41:58,466 --> 00:41:59,796
Like what?

312
00:42:00,885 --> 00:42:02,425
Vulnerable.

313
00:42:04,347 --> 00:42:05,767
I'm retired.

314

00:45:25,339 --> 00:45:27,049
Mr. Wick.

332
00:45:34,307 --> 00:45:36,597
Are you here on business, sir?

333
00:45:37,518 --> 00:45:39,148
Afraid so, Francis.

334
00:45:40,188 --> 00:45:42,858
Why don't you take the night off.

335
00:45:48,196 --> 00:45:49,616
Thank you, sir.

336
00:46:20,811 --> 00:46:22,311
Fuck you, motherfucker.

337
00:46:28,945 --> 00:46:31,615
Where is Iosef?

338
00:46:33,699 --> 00:46:36,079
Bathhouse, downstairs.

339
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:42,033

Come on! Come on!

343
00:53:43,003 --> 00:53:44,663
Good evening, Mr. Wick.

344
00:53:44,755 --> 00:53:45,755
Good evening.

345
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:47,379
How may I be of service?

346
00:53:47,466 --> 00:53:50,386
- Is the doctor in?
- Yes, sir. 24/7.

347
00:53:50,469 --> 00:53:52,349
- Send him up, please.
- Yes, sir.

348
00:53:52,429 --> 00:53:53,929
How good's your laundry?

349
00:53:55,808 --> 00:53:58,768
I'm sorry to say that no one's <i>that </i>good.

350
00:53:59,478 --> 00:54:02,188
No. I thought not.

351
00:54:02,272 --> 00:54:05,112
May I suggest a drink, sir.

352
00:54:05,192 --> 00:54:06,742
Bourbon, perhaps.

353
00:54:08,112 --> 00:54:09,862
That sounds perfect.

354
00:54:24,128 --> 00:54:26,588
So what sort of movement am I looking at?

355
00:54:26,672 --> 00:54:29,302
Well, if you're lookin' to heal...

356
00:54:29,383 --> 00:54:30,883
then keep it marginal.

357
00:54:32,845 --> 00:54:35,305
However, if you still have...

358
00:54:35,389 --> 00:54:37,679
business to attend to...

359
00:54:37,766 --> 00:54:39,766
uh...

360
00:54:39,852 --> 00:54:42,232
take two of these beforehand.

361
00:54:43,439 --> 00:54:47,029
Your stitches'll tear and you'll bleed...

362
00:54:47,109 --> 00:54:49,819
but you'll have full function.

363
00:54:49,903 --> 00:54:51,813
Do you need anything for the pain?

364
00:54:53,323 --> 00:54:55,403
No, I've got that covered.

365
00:56:02,476 --> 00:56:03,476
Hey, John.

366
00:56:06,897 --> 00:56:09,317
- Perkins?
- I thought I'd let myself in.

367
00:56:11,026 --> 00:56:12,896
I noticed.

368
00:56:20,285 --> 00:56:23,155
I never knew Ms. Perkins
to get out of bed for less than three.

369
00:56:23,247 --> 00:56:25,077
Viggo's giving me four
to break hotel rules.

370
00:56:25,165 --> 00:56:27,625
That's unwise, I assure you.

371
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,507
You were always a pussy.

372
00:57:51,418 --> 00:57:52,708
Yes?

373
00:57:52,794 --> 00:57:55,414
<i>I apologize for calling you
at this hour...</i>

374
00:57:55,505 --> 00:57:59,135
but we have received
a number of grievances from your floor...

375
00:57:59,217 --> 00:58:00,927
concerning the noise.

376
00:58:03,096 --> 00:58:04,386
My apologies.

377
00:58:04,473 --> 00:58:08,303
I was dealing with an uninvited guest.

378
00:58:08,393 --> 00:58:10,183
<i>Have you need then of, say...</i>

379
00:58:10,270 --> 00:58:12,400
a dinner reservation, perhaps?

380
00:58:12,481 --> 00:58:15,781
Perhaps. I'll have to get back to you.

381
00:58:23,283 --> 00:58:25,283
No! Aah!

382
00:58:25,369 --> 00:58:26,959
Where's Iosef?

383
00:58:27,037 --> 00:58:28,367
Fuck you.

384
00:58:28,455 --> 00:58:31,745
- Where's Viggo?
- I'm not telling you shit!

385
00:58:31,833 --> 00:58:34,493
Do you really wanna die here, Perkins?

386
00:58:35,963 --> 00:58:37,963
Give me somethin'.

387
00:58:41,802 --> 00:58:43,392
Little Russia.

388
00:58:43,470 --> 00:58:46,270
There's a church near Cannon Court.

389
00:58:46,348 --> 00:58:49,138
<i>- What about it?
- It's a front.</i>

390
00:58:49,226 --> 00:58:51,646
It's where Viggo keeps his private stash.

391
00:58:52,729 --> 00:58:54,819
Thank you.

392
00:59:01,822 --> 00:59:03,662
Do I know you?

393
00:59:05,033 --> 00:59:07,073
I'm thinkin' so.

394
00:59:13,917 --> 00:59:15,417
Hey, John.

395
00:59:15,502 --> 00:59:17,262
Hey, Harry.

396
00:59:17,337 --> 00:59:18,917
Everything all right?

397
00:59:19,006 --> 00:59:22,796
Yeah. Everything's fine.

398
00:59:22,884 --> 00:59:26,004
- I'll leave you to it then.
- Hey, Harry.

399
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:31,061
You keen on earning a coin?
Babysittin' the sleepin' one?

400
00:59:31,143 --> 00:59:33,973
- Catch and release?
- Catch and release.

401
01:00:05,635 --> 01:00:08,005
My son, how might I help you?

402
01:00:14,394 --> 01:00:17,064
Motherfucker!

403
01:00:26,573 --> 01:00:28,613
Let's go to the vault.

404
01:00:40,295 --> 01:00:41,665
Open it.

405
01:00:48,428 --> 01:00:49,928
Viggo will kill me.

406
01:00:54,810 --> 01:00:56,600
Uh-huh.

407
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:09,614
Ladies, out.

408
01:01:22,379 --> 01:01:26,469
Honestly, what do you think
you're going to do with all of that?

409
01:01:26,550 --> 01:01:28,800
This.

410
01:02:16,766 --> 01:02:19,436
Don't worry.

411
01:02:19,519 --> 01:02:22,229
Housekeeping will find you.

412
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:24,314
Treat all your ladies like this?

413
01:02:24,399 --> 01:02:27,609
You are no lady. Trust me.

414
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:36,534
Harry, is it?

415
01:02:38,371 --> 01:02:41,541
How would you like to earn
more than just a gold coin?

416
01:02:44,085 --> 01:02:45,875
You've broken the rules.

417
01:02:45,962 --> 01:02:48,972
You've done business
on Continental grounds.

418
01:02:49,925 --> 01:02:52,545
And management does not take kindly...

419
01:02:52,636 --> 01:02:54,716
to that sort of behavior.

420
01:02:56,097 --> 01:02:58,387
Fuck management.

421
01:03:04,564 --> 01:03:07,024
Don't worry. Housekeeping'll find you.

422
01:03:13,615 --> 01:03:15,235
Ashes to ashes.

423
01:03:16,868 --> 01:03:20,708
- Can we recover from this?
- Viggo, you know what was in that vault, right?

424
01:03:25,752 --> 01:03:27,672
Shit.

425
01:03:42,352 --> 01:03:44,612
Come on!

426
01:05:02,932 --> 01:05:05,732
I'll say this, John.

427
01:05:05,810 --> 01:05:08,690
They sure as fuck broke the mold with you.

428
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:13,186
Ay-yi.

429
01:05:22,494 --> 01:05:25,454
You always had a certain...

430
01:05:25,538 --> 01:05:28,168
audacity about you, you know.

431
01:05:29,250 --> 01:05:31,380
Yeah.

432
01:05:34,297 --> 01:05:39,547
I can say you're still very much
the John Wick of old.

433
01:05:40,470 --> 01:05:42,060
Am I?

434
01:05:45,225 --> 01:05:48,975
People don't change. You know that.

435
01:05:49,062 --> 01:05:51,192
Times, they do.

436
01:05:54,859 --> 01:05:58,199
Do you know what was in that vault?

437
01:05:58,279 --> 01:06:00,319
Artwork, cash, not without its worth.

438
01:06:00,407 --> 01:06:02,867
But the leverage I had on this city...

439
01:06:02,951 --> 01:06:06,961
audio recordings,
physical evidence, blackmail...

440
01:06:07,038 --> 01:06:08,578
it was fuckin' priceless!

441
01:06:09,582 --> 01:06:11,092
Priceless!

442
01:06:13,670 --> 01:06:16,420
Yeah. I kind of enjoyed that.

443
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,336
Yeah.

444
01:06:18,425 --> 01:06:21,425
Yeah, I know you did. Yeah.

445
01:06:22,554 --> 01:06:24,174
Are you really laughing?

446
01:06:31,187 --> 01:06:32,767
So...

447
01:06:35,817 --> 01:06:39,237
Ah, then you got married, huh?
Settled down.

448
01:06:39,320 --> 01:06:41,910
How did you manage that anyways?

449
01:06:41,990 --> 01:06:43,620
Luck, I guess.

450
01:06:44,617 --> 01:06:46,827
Yeah.

451
01:06:46,911 --> 01:06:49,871
Yeah, while you had your wife,
I had my son.

452
01:06:49,956 --> 01:06:52,916
And believe me, you had a far better deal.

453
01:06:58,465 --> 01:06:59,875
And then you left.

454
01:06:59,966 --> 01:07:02,386
And the way you got out...

455
01:07:02,469 --> 01:07:07,809
lying to yourself that
the past held no sway over the future.

456
01:07:07,891 --> 01:07:09,641
But in the end...

457
01:07:11,311 --> 01:07:16,071
a lot of us are rewarded
for our misdeeds...

458
01:07:16,149 --> 01:07:19,989
which is why God took your wife...

459
01:07:21,571 --> 01:07:24,121
and unleashed you upon me.

460
01:07:25,825 --> 01:07:28,445
This life...

461
01:07:28,536 --> 01:07:30,536
follows you.

462
01:07:32,248 --> 01:07:34,788
It clings to you...

463
01:07:34,876 --> 01:07:40,126
infecting everyone who comes close to you.

464
01:07:40,215 --> 01:07:43,175
We are cursed, you and I.

465
01:07:44,594 --> 01:07:48,014
On that we agree.

466
01:07:51,851 --> 01:07:54,061
Finally, common ground.

467
01:07:55,063 --> 01:07:56,763
Okay.

468
01:07:56,856 --> 01:07:58,526
Step aside.

469
01:07:58,608 --> 01:08:01,198
Give me your son.

470
01:08:01,778 --> 01:08:03,488
John Wick.

471
01:08:09,118 --> 01:08:12,618
It was just a fucking car.
Just a fuckin' dog.

472
01:08:12,705 --> 01:08:14,665
Just a dog.

473
01:08:15,875 --> 01:08:17,455
Viggo.

474
01:08:18,586 --> 01:08:20,006
Yeah?

475
01:08:20,088 --> 01:08:22,338
When Helen died, I lost everything.

476
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:26,633
Until that dog arrived on my doorstep...

477
01:08:26,719 --> 01:08:29,519
a final gift from my wife.

478
01:08:29,597 --> 01:08:33,727
In that moment, I received
some semblance of hope...

479
01:08:36,062 --> 01:08:38,902
an opportunity to grieve unalone.

480
01:08:40,733 --> 01:08:43,233
And your son...

481
01:08:43,319 --> 01:08:44,989
took that from me.

482
01:08:45,071 --> 01:08:48,121
- Oh, God.
- Stole that from me.

483
01:08:48,199 --> 01:08:51,079
Killed that from me!

484
01:08:51,160 --> 01:08:53,660
People keep asking if I'm back...

485
01:08:53,746 --> 01:08:56,416
and I haven't really had an answer.

486
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:59,919
But now, yeah, I'm thinkin' I'm back.

487
01:09:00,003 --> 01:09:03,213
So you can either hand over your son...

488
01:09:03,298 --> 01:09:06,428
or you can die screaming alongside him!

489
01:11:43,916 --> 01:11:45,876
Cool it. Cool it.

490
01:11:46,878 --> 01:11:48,298
John!

491
01:11:49,922 --> 01:11:51,932
- Aah! Jesus.
- Where is he?

492
01:11:53,760 --> 01:11:55,390
Shit!

493
01:11:59,932 --> 01:12:04,192
I have your word then, if I tell you where
he is, that you'll let me walk away?

494
01:12:04,270 --> 01:12:05,770
Pull the contract.

495
01:12:09,776 --> 01:12:11,396
Done.

496
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,162
He's kept in a safe house. Brooklyn.

497
01:12:19,243 --> 01:12:22,113
434 Wallace Place.

498
01:12:23,873 --> 01:12:26,373
- They know you're coming.
- Of course.

499
01:12:26,459 --> 01:12:27,959

Thank you.

522
01:15:44,782 --> 01:15:46,492
Our pleasure, sir.

523
01:15:49,620 --> 01:15:53,250
A parting gift. From the management.

524
01:15:53,332 --> 01:15:55,672
Compensation
for last night's unfortunate...

525
01:15:56,836 --> 01:15:58,836
incident.

526
01:16:45,718 --> 01:16:48,638
How many times
do I have to save your ass?

527
01:16:48,721 --> 01:16:51,731
- I appreciate it.
- Of course.

528
01:16:51,807 --> 01:16:53,807
You look terrible.

529
01:16:53,893 --> 01:16:55,803
No, I look retired.

530
01:16:55,895 --> 01:16:57,225
Retired?

531
01:16:57,313 --> 01:16:59,393
You really believe that?

532
01:17:12,578 --> 01:17:14,708
You made a new life.

533
01:17:17,124 --> 01:17:19,244
You'll find your way back to it.

534
01:17:20,461 --> 01:17:22,711
It's time to go home.

535
01:18:16,308 --> 01:18:20,478
Let's get on with this,
whatever the fuck this is.

536
01:18:20,563 --> 01:18:22,223
Hello, Marcus.

537
01:18:34,660 --> 01:18:36,000
This is John.

538
01:18:37,496 --> 01:18:40,626
I appreciate you granting my son
a swift death.

539
01:18:42,918 --> 01:18:45,798
<i>I wouldn't know
how to reply to that either.</i>

540
01:18:47,673 --> 01:18:49,923
Marcus betrayed me.

541
01:19:00,686 --> 01:19:02,936
You pulled the contract.

542
01:19:03,022 --> 01:19:07,692
And while it was open,
you had every chance...

543
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:10,946
every opportunity to kill John Wick.

544
01:19:11,030 --> 01:19:14,280
And if you had done your job...

545
01:19:14,366 --> 01:19:16,616
my son would be still alive!

546
01:19:19,371 --> 01:19:20,961
<i>And in so doing...</i>

547

01:19:25,169 --> 01:19:26,709
Thank you.

549
01:19:29,757 --> 01:19:31,297
Ms. Perkins.

550
01:19:32,968 --> 01:19:35,138
Why am I not surprised?

551
01:19:35,221 --> 01:19:37,391
In for a penny, in for a pound.

01:19:38,933 --> 01:19:42,393
<i>So, John, I had no choice.</i>

553
01:19:43,270 --> 01:19:45,690
I always liked you, Marcus.

Oh...

556
01:19:58,077 --> 01:20:01,957
But unlike the others,
you go out on my terms.

557
01:20:02,039 --> 01:20:05,499
Aah! No! No!

558
01:20:07,586 --> 01:20:09,416
No, my good sir.

559
01:20:10,881 --> 01:20:12,881
I go out on my own.

<i>Ms. Perkins,
I apologize for calling you at this hour.</i>

577
01:22:18,092 --> 01:22:20,352
Ms. Perkins.

578
01:22:20,427 --> 01:22:23,057
Your membership
to the Continental has been...

579
01:22:23,138 --> 01:22:26,228
by thine own hand, revoked.

<i>We live by a code.</i>

582
01:22:57,297 --> 01:22:59,177
Which is why I'm not the one
telling you that...

583
01:22:59,201 --> 01:23:00,971
a certain helicopter
at a certain helipad...

584
01:23:01,051 --> 01:23:03,721
is being fueled for a certain someone.

585
01:23:22,698 --> 01:23:25,058
- Have you got my cigarettes?
- Yeah, I got your cigarettes.

586
01:23:48,557 --> 01:23:49,887
Oh, fuck!

587
01:23:53,145 --> 01:23:54,805
Yeah. Super. Let's go. Faster!

588
01:23:54,897 --> 01:23:57,147
The helicopter's right down there.
Come on! Let's go!

589
01:24:10,162 --> 01:24:13,422
Shit! Goddamn, I knew he'd come.

590
01:24:28,013 --> 01:24:29,413
What's fuckin' wrong with this guy?

591
01:24:29,431 --> 01:24:32,141
Somebody give me a gun. Who's got a gun?

592
01:24:34,186 --> 01:24:36,516
Oh, God! My fucking head.

593
01:24:37,564 --> 01:24:40,274
- That was a good one.
- Who's got a gun?

594
01:24:54,873 --> 01:24:57,453
Fuck!

595
01:25:14,393 --> 01:25:17,223
The helicopter's right over there.
We have to get over there.

596
01:25:33,662 --> 01:25:35,872
Oh, my God, I need a gun.

597
01:25:58,270 --> 01:25:59,690

598
01:25:59,771 --> 01:26:01,861
Good luck.

605
01:27:43,834 --> 01:27:45,374
No more bullets.

609
01:28:23,582 --> 01:28:26,212
We were professionals. Civilized.

610
01:28:26,293 --> 01:28:28,413
Do I look civilized to you?

611
01:29:51,294 --> 01:29:53,254
Be seeing you, John.

612
01:29:55,006 --> 01:29:56,626
Yeah.
