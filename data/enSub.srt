1
00:12:06,143 --> 00:12:07,603
Just wanted to see

2
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:11,982
So, then, you're comfortable, then?

3
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:13,650
Do you need anything?

4
00:12:14,484 --> 00:12:15,235
No.

5
00:12:15,944 --> 00:12:16,778
I'm fine.

6
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:17,738
Thank you.

7
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:19,907
Good. Good.

8
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:46,808
I'm so happy you're here.

9
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:14,127
Shall I shut the lamp?

10
00:13:14,628 --> 00:13:15,587
What for?

11
00:13:21,552 --> 00:13:22,803
I'll shut the lamp.

12
00:13:45,617 --> 00:13:47,160
It's raining cats and dogs.

13
00:13:52,708 --> 00:13:54,793
I said, it's raining cats and dogs.

14
00:13:54,918 --> 00:13:55,919
Yes, I heard you.

15
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:58,672
You might have answered.

16
00:13:59,173 --> 00:13:59,923
I'm sorry.

17
00:14:01,675 --> 00:14:02,593
I've gotten used to not speaking...

18
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:04,094
...unless I have something to say.

19
00:14:04,511 --> 00:14:07,181
If nobody spoke unless
they had something to say...

20
00:14:07,723 --> 00:14:10,225
...the human race would soon
lose the power of speech.

21
00:14:18,150 --> 00:14:18,984
Walter.

22
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:23,989
I'm sorry.

23
00:14:26,283 --> 00:14:26,909
You're right.

24
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:32,748
What shall we do? Shall we...

25
00:14:33,874 --> 00:14:35,375
...shall we play a game?

26
00:14:35,667 --> 00:14:37,878
You don't like the games I play.
They bore you.

27
00:14:37,961 --> 00:14:38,795
Nonsense.

28
00:14:40,047 --> 00:14:40,964
Let's play cards.

29
00:14:51,308 --> 00:14:53,393
Do you think you'd enjoy a night out?

30
00:14:55,479 --> 00:14:57,773
We have an invitation for
Saturday night.

31
00:14:57,898 --> 00:14:58,607
From whom?

32
00:14:59,149 --> 00:15:00,067
The Townsends.

33
00:15:02,152 --> 00:15:03,403
Dorothy Townsend.

34
00:15:03,820 --> 00:15:05,155
Do you not like her?

35
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:08,075
Well, I've only met her once,

36
00:15:08,617 --> 00:15:10,410
but there's no reason for her
to put on such airs.

37
00:15:10,494 --> 00:15:11,119
Does she?

38
00:15:11,328 --> 00:15:13,330
Yes. I have no idea why.

39
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,999
She was what?
Married to a vice consul?

40
00:15:17,376 --> 00:15:20,087
Honestly, they're absurd,
this Shanghai set.

41
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:22,256
Mother wouldn't dream of asking
half of them to dinner.

42
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,591
I'm taking that black five.

43
00:15:28,345 --> 00:15:30,013
Well, it's all right.

44
00:15:30,514 --> 00:15:31,765
I thought you might enjoy it,

45
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,601
but we certainly don't have to go.

46
00:15:36,019 --> 00:15:37,187
I don't care either way.

47
00:15:41,859 --> 00:15:42,818
Go where?

48
00:15:53,662 --> 00:15:55,122
- Kitty Fane?
- Hello, Dorothy.

49
00:15:55,330 --> 00:15:56,290
I'm so glad you could come.

50
00:15:56,999 --> 00:15:57,958
This is Walter.

51
00:15:58,041 --> 00:15:59,209
I'm pleased to meet you.

52
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:00,210
This is my husband.

53
00:16:00,878 --> 00:16:02,838
Charlie, stop talking and
greet our guests.

54
00:16:04,298 --> 00:16:05,340
- You know Mr. Fane.
- Charlie.

55
00:16:05,465 --> 00:16:07,134
It's Dr. Fane, darling.

56
00:16:07,426 --> 00:16:09,636
Oh, dear. I do beg your pardon,
Dr. Fane.

57
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:10,554
Not at all.

58
00:16:10,888 --> 00:16:12,556
And this is Dr. Fane's wife, Kitty.

59
00:16:12,973 --> 00:16:13,807
Mrs. Fane.

60
00:16:14,224 --> 00:16:14,933
Mr. Townsend.

61
00:16:15,142 --> 00:16:16,810
I do apologize, Dr. Fane.

62
00:16:17,019 --> 00:16:18,562
I assumed you worked with Charlie
at the consulate.

63
00:16:18,687 --> 00:16:19,938
Oh, no. Nothing so glamorous.

64
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:21,315
I'm at the Civil Laboratory.

65
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:25,485
The government lab? How fascinating.

66
00:16:53,931 --> 00:16:54,973
Are you enjoying it?

67
00:16:55,933 --> 00:16:57,184
I've never seen anything like it.

68
00:17:03,106 --> 00:17:04,566
Every gesture has a meaning.

69
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,069
See how she covers her face
with the cloth?

70
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,571
She is mourning her misfortune.

71
00:17:11,240 --> 00:17:12,699
What happened to her?

72
00:17:17,079 --> 00:17:19,164
She was sold into slavery.

73
00:17:20,415 --> 00:17:23,335
Condemned to a life of drudgery
and despair...

74
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:26,463
...in a strange land far from home.

75
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,174
See the chains?

76
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:33,345
They represent the heavy bondage
of her poor trapped soul...

77
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,222
...from which there is no escape.

78
00:17:38,058 --> 00:17:39,393
And so she weeps.

79
00:17:40,435 --> 00:17:41,895
She weeps for the lively,

80
00:17:42,104 --> 00:17:43,981
vivacious girl she once was...

81
00:17:47,109 --> 00:17:48,902
...for the lonely woman she has become.

82
00:17:51,905 --> 00:17:53,282
And most of all...

83
00:17:54,324 --> 00:17:56,785
...she weeps for the love
she'll never feel...

84
00:17:58,662 --> 00:18:01,081
...for the love she'll never give.

85
00:18:04,501 --> 00:18:05,878
Is that really what she's saying?

86
00:18:08,255 --> 00:18:10,340
Actually, I haven't a clue what
she's on about.

87
00:18:10,757 --> 00:18:12,050
I don't speak Chinese.

88
00:19:37,094 --> 00:19:37,845
What was that?

89
00:19:41,932 --> 00:19:43,141
Perhaps it was the amah,
or one of the...

90
00:19:56,321 --> 00:19:57,030
They've gone.

91
00:20:02,119 --> 00:20:03,078
He heard us.

92
00:20:03,495 --> 00:20:03,996
Who?

93
00:20:04,663 --> 00:20:05,706
Walter.

94
00:20:07,374 --> 00:20:09,209
Walter. What if it was?

95
00:20:10,252 --> 00:20:11,962
For all he knows you were taking a nap.

96
00:20:12,045 --> 00:20:13,005
With my doors locked?

97
00:20:13,297 --> 00:20:16,008
Kitty, dear, you need a drink.

98
00:20:21,638 --> 00:20:23,807
Even if it was,
my impression is he'll do nothing.

99
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:26,143
That's flattering.

100
00:20:26,310 --> 00:20:27,144
He knows as well as anyone...

101
00:20:27,269 --> 00:20:29,021
...there's nothing to be gained by
making a scandal.

102
00:20:30,189 --> 00:20:33,400
Has it occurred to you that my husband
is in love with me?

103
00:20:39,656 --> 00:20:42,201
I have a feeling you're about to say
something awful.

104
00:20:42,993 --> 00:20:46,747
It's just that women are often under
the impression that...

105
00:20:46,872 --> 00:20:49,500
...men are much more in love with them
than they really are.

106
00:20:50,751 --> 00:20:53,754
I wouldn't delude myself for a second
that you were in love with me.

107
00:20:57,090 --> 00:20:58,217
Now there you're wrong.

108
00:21:09,520 --> 00:21:10,521
Do you like your present?

109
00:21:12,731 --> 00:21:13,857
It's good enough.

110
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:28,080
Charlie?

111
00:21:30,040 --> 00:21:32,543
Do I make you as happy as
you make me?

112
00:21:34,127 --> 00:21:35,671
Of course you do, darling.

113
00:22:07,035 --> 00:22:09,663
(Miss you Father)
