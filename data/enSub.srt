1
00:40:06,698 --> 00:40:07,741
dying of cholera?

2
00:40:07,825 --> 00:40:08,992
No. All of the fluid goes out of you...

3
00:40:09,076 --> 00:40:10,619
...in the first 36 hours.

4
00:40:10,869 --> 00:40:12,496
You die of dehydration, actually.

5
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:15,249
So, it's messy and very painful.

6
00:40:16,583 --> 00:40:17,501
But it is relatively quick.

7
00:40:20,337 --> 00:40:20,963
Good night.

8
00:40:48,282 --> 00:40:49,616
It's rather unfortunate.

9
00:40:50,868 --> 00:40:52,035
I thought perhaps that you and
your wife...

10
00:40:52,119 --> 00:40:55,789
...you'd like to take precautions in case
you have to leave this place.

11
00:40:55,998 --> 00:40:57,791
Do you think all this is really necessary?

12
00:40:57,875 --> 00:40:58,917
You can see the picture.

13
00:40:59,626 --> 00:41:03,630
I thought you'd like to put
your wife's mind...

14
00:41:03,714 --> 00:41:06,008
...at rest from this situation.

15
00:41:08,302 --> 00:41:10,596
This is Colonel Yu.
He's the KMT's man.

16
00:41:11,346 --> 00:41:13,724
He's posting one of his men here
at the house.

17
00:41:14,558 --> 00:41:15,392
Am I a prisoner?

18
00:41:15,726 --> 00:41:17,895
No. It was Mr. Waddington's
idea actually.

19
00:41:18,812 --> 00:41:20,189
He feels we should take precautions.

20
00:41:20,731 --> 00:41:21,648
Precautions against what?

21
00:41:23,859 --> 00:41:26,320
A few days ago,
British troops opened fire...

22
00:41:26,320 --> 00:41:29,656
...on a group of Chinese workers who
were demonstrating in Shanghai.

23
00:41:30,407 --> 00:41:31,575
Eleven were killed.

24
00:41:32,910 --> 00:41:34,161
We've only just heard.

25
00:41:34,661 --> 00:41:36,580
Those were plastered around
the town last night.

26
00:41:36,663 --> 00:41:38,540
(Death to foreign murderers!)

27
00:41:39,917 --> 00:41:40,918
I shouldn't worry too much.

28
00:41:41,752 --> 00:41:43,545
Even the Nationalists are afraid
of cholera.

29
00:42:42,062 --> 00:42:43,188
Do they take that water from the well?

30
00:42:44,857 --> 00:42:46,650
Colonel, can I see where they get
their drinking water?

31
00:42:46,817 --> 00:42:47,651
(Imperialist pig!)

32
00:43:02,666 --> 00:43:03,959
For starters,
we've got to stop people from...

33
00:43:04,168 --> 00:43:05,919
...using this well until I can test it.

34
00:43:13,427 --> 00:43:14,261
Do you understand?

35
00:43:15,429 --> 00:43:17,181
Yes, I understand, Dr. Fane.

36
00:43:18,015 --> 00:43:20,517
I received my military training
in Moscow.

37
00:43:21,268 --> 00:43:22,603
If you don't like English,

38
00:43:22,728 --> 00:43:23,770
we can speak Russian.

39
00:43:25,105 --> 00:43:26,440
English will be fine. Thank you.

40
00:43:42,289 --> 00:43:43,040
Here.

41
00:43:43,874 --> 00:43:45,876
You have seen cholera before,
yes, Doctor?

42
00:43:45,959 --> 00:43:47,211
At the laboratory, of course.

43
00:43:47,294 --> 00:43:48,670
No, I mean in a patient.

44
00:43:48,962 --> 00:43:50,756
No. No, I haven't had the chance

45
00:43:55,552 --> 00:43:56,887
Well, I'm not a clinician.

46
00:43:57,304 --> 00:43:58,388
Did they not tell you?

47
00:43:58,680 --> 00:43:59,932
I'm an infectious disease specialist.

48
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:04,645
Shall we?

49
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:06,897
After you, Doctor.

50
00:45:11,879 --> 00:45:13,338
(Charlie)

51
00:45:15,716 --> 00:45:21,805
(without you it is intolerable)

52
00:45:31,690 --> 00:45:32,733
I don't need you.

53
00:45:35,736 --> 00:45:36,570
Go back!

54
00:45:45,454 --> 00:45:46,288
Mr. Waddington?

55
00:45:51,502 --> 00:45:52,836
I'm looking for Mr. Waddington.

56
00:46:06,725 --> 00:46:09,937
Wait here. All right?

57
00:46:16,026 --> 00:46:16,860
Hello?

58
00:46:17,569 --> 00:46:18,695
Mr. Waddington?

59
00:46:29,248 --> 00:46:29,873
Mrs. Fane?

60
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:32,376
Good morning.

61
00:46:38,298 --> 00:46:39,550
What can I do for you, Mrs. Fane?

62
00:46:40,300 --> 00:46:42,177
I found a record for you.

63
00:46:44,888 --> 00:46:45,931
Stravinsky.

64
00:46:46,640 --> 00:46:48,433
Very modern. Thank you.

65
00:46:51,645 --> 00:46:52,604
Was there something else?

66
00:46:54,481 --> 00:46:56,358
I was wondering if you could tell me...

67
00:46:56,483 --> 00:46:57,734
...when the post comes through.

68
00:46:57,818 --> 00:46:58,735
It's for Shanghai.

69
00:46:59,153 --> 00:47:00,737
Unfortunately, since the cholera,

70
00:47:00,737 --> 00:47:02,823
the cowards won't venture
past the river port...

71
00:47:02,906 --> 00:47:04,575
...but leave it with me.

72
00:47:05,409 --> 00:47:07,494
A local trader I know is making the trip
on Friday.

73
00:47:09,288 --> 00:47:10,330
Townsend.

74
00:47:11,373 --> 00:47:12,207
Charlie Townsend?

75
00:47:12,416 --> 00:47:14,585
Yes. He's an acquaintance
of my husband.

76
00:47:15,961 --> 00:47:17,212
Do you know him?

77
00:47:17,504 --> 00:47:20,549
Years ago. We were both assigned
to the consulate in Shanghai.

78
00:47:22,092 --> 00:47:23,177
Charming wife?

79
00:47:24,094 --> 00:47:25,679
Yes. They're very popular, aren't they?

80
00:47:26,096 --> 00:47:27,848
He'd made a science of popularity.

81
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:30,017
So, you know his family?

82
00:47:30,267 --> 00:47:32,519
Well, well enough. I like Dorothy.

83
00:47:33,687 --> 00:47:36,190
Yes, I understand they're quite
the devoted couple.

84
00:47:37,357 --> 00:47:38,901
Oh, he had his little flirtations.

85
00:47:40,569 --> 00:47:41,695
Nothing serious.

86
00:47:43,489 --> 00:47:45,991
I once heard her say that she found it
most unflattering...

87
00:47:46,116 --> 00:47:47,534
...that the women who fell
for her husband...

88
00:47:47,659 --> 00:47:49,870
...were so consistently second-rate.

89
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:59,213
Well, enjoy the record.

90
00:48:00,881 --> 00:48:01,715
Mrs. Fane?

91
00:48:04,051 --> 00:48:04,968
The letter.

92
00:48:06,720 --> 00:48:07,554
Right.

93
00:48:08,305 --> 00:48:10,891
Yes, it suddenly occurred to me that
Friday's much too late.

94
00:48:11,725 --> 00:48:12,893
Thanks all the same.

95
00:48:39,086 --> 00:48:40,504
Can you pass the salt, please?

96
00:48:45,217 --> 00:48:46,176
I'm sorry. Did you say something?

97
00:48:47,302 --> 00:48:48,554
Could you pass the salt?

98
00:48:53,976 --> 00:48:54,601
Thank you.

99
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:12,452
So, this is how it's going to be?

100
00:49:14,538 --> 00:49:17,207
Passing her evenings in silence.

101
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:24,631
Walter.

102
00:49:27,551 --> 00:49:28,385
Walter!

103
00:49:30,137 --> 00:49:32,139
I wonder if you haven't gone insane.

104
00:49:40,689 --> 00:49:41,940
- She's not cooking it.
- Leave it.

105
00:49:43,484 --> 00:49:44,318
Leave it.

106
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:47,070
Thank you.

107
00:49:56,330 --> 00:49:57,581
Are you looking to kill yourself?
