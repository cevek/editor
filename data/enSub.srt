1
01:23:53,909 --> 01:23:54,827
Walter?

2
01:23:58,288 --> 01:23:59,832
Why didn't you break down that door...

3
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:01,917
...when you knew I was in there
with Charlie?

4
01:24:04,336 --> 01:24:06,630
You might have at least tried
to thrash him.

5
01:24:08,799 --> 01:24:09,967
He wasn't worth it.

6
01:24:14,638 --> 01:24:16,306
Or maybe I'm just too proud to fight.

7
01:24:18,058 --> 01:24:19,434
I don't know about that.

8
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:25,274
(Bury corpses immediately.)

9
01:24:25,566 --> 01:24:28,402
(Please don't take him away!)

10
01:24:28,485 --> 01:24:31,655
(His spirit will never rest!)

11
01:24:47,504 --> 01:24:51,008
I've told Mother Superior to keep her
sisters inside the convent.

12
01:24:51,550 --> 01:24:53,010
I put a guard outside the gate.

13
01:24:54,052 --> 01:24:56,972
I'd advise any Westerners
to stay indoors.

14
01:24:57,055 --> 01:24:57,931
All right.

15
01:25:06,565 --> 01:25:09,067
Sister, has Mrs. Fane been
at the convent today?

16
01:25:09,193 --> 01:25:12,112
Yes. But she, she has left
a few minutes ago.

17
01:25:20,204 --> 01:25:22,831
(This is the work of the British devil!)

18
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:25,667
(Respect our traditions!)

19
01:25:40,057 --> 01:25:40,974
Sung Ching.

20
01:25:43,268 --> 01:25:44,228
Let's go!

21
01:25:44,937 --> 01:25:45,562
Let's go!

22
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:48,065
Let's go!

23
01:26:19,138 --> 01:26:22,349
Sung Ching. Where's Mrs. Fane?
Where's Mrs. Fane?!

24
01:26:39,158 --> 01:26:40,409
I don't know what you're saying!

25
01:26:41,243 --> 01:26:42,494
Get away from her.

26
01:26:43,328 --> 01:26:44,580
- Are you all right?
- Yes.

27
01:27:01,680 --> 01:27:02,389
Come on.

28
01:27:28,707 --> 01:27:29,625
We're out of whiskey.

29
01:28:03,283 --> 01:28:04,535
Dr. Fane.

30
01:28:05,494 --> 01:28:06,745
Could I trouble you for a drink?

31
01:28:34,898 --> 01:28:35,732
Hello, darling.

32
01:28:54,001 --> 01:28:57,629
I was stationed at Hankow
during the revolution...

33
01:28:57,754 --> 01:28:59,840
...when they were massacring
all the Manchus.

34
01:29:01,175 --> 01:29:03,886
I was able to help a particular family.

35
01:29:04,178 --> 01:29:05,971
New documents, that sort of thing.

36
01:29:07,014 --> 01:29:08,807
She was the youngest of the daughters.

37
01:29:10,976 --> 01:29:13,896
I didn't pay her too much attention
at first.

38
01:29:14,938 --> 01:29:17,941
Well, more than I should have,
I suppose.

39
01:29:19,818 --> 01:29:23,405
When I left Hankow, she followed me.

40
01:29:24,865 --> 01:29:28,285
I sent her back two, three times.
But she...

41
01:29:29,203 --> 01:29:30,454
...she kept coming back.

42
01:29:36,710 --> 01:29:39,546
I didn't realize you had so much
affection for her.

43
01:29:39,963 --> 01:29:41,131
What makes you think I do?

44
01:29:44,259 --> 01:29:46,345
I can see it in your eyes.

45
01:29:50,307 --> 01:29:51,850
Men are incalculable.

46
01:29:54,061 --> 01:29:56,021
I thought you were just like
everybody else...

47
01:29:56,313 --> 01:29:58,941
...now I feel I don't know the first thing
about you.

48
01:30:04,071 --> 01:30:05,614
I wonder what she sees in you.

49
01:30:08,408 --> 01:30:09,159
Wan Xi.

50
01:30:19,253 --> 01:30:21,588
She says I'm a good man.

51
01:30:31,348 --> 01:30:34,184
As if a woman ever loved a man
for his virtue.
